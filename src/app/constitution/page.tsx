            <p>
              We, the brothers of the Asian American Brotherhood, have united ourselves in order to forge a stronger sense of unity among Asian Americans in our community and to foster solidarity without coercion. In promoting understanding and bonds across ethnic lines, the Asian American Brotherhood seeks to empower both our members and the communities that we serve.
            </p>
  
            {/* Article I */}
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Article I - Circumstance and Necessity</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Section 1.</strong> Asian Americans at Harvard are divided along various ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Despite our differences, however, all of us are faced with a similar challenge: overcoming obstacles fixed by society based solely on race. We must unite the diversity of our perspectives in order to rise successfully to this challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Section 2.</strong> The various Asian American ethnic groups on campus have neglected to unite for the sake of what should be our common goal: to provide a collective voice for the Asian American community. Consequently, misunderstandings among individual organizations have led to a fragmentation of the Asian American community at Harvard, compromising the unity of our voice and the recognition of our presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Section 3.</strong> The absence of unity and the lack of a common goal have resulted in widespread apathy among Asian Americans at Harvard and beyond. We must address this lack of motivation and participation in our culture and identity for, if ignored, it unquestionably exacerbates the current condition of society.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Section 4.</strong> The aforementioned circumstances are the grounds that have given birth to the Asian American Brotherhood. <strong>WE HAVE FORMED OUT OF NECESSITY.</strong> A fraternal social structure allows us to transcend the fundamental constraints inherent in the structure of traditional organizations. Our undying loyalty to one another marks the beginning of a proud tradition.
            </p>
